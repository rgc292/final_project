========================
Team Member: Menghan Yuan, Xu Xu

This is the Instruction of NY Complaints.

The 'Main.py' is used to run the project.

After the welcome, there will be a histogram on the overall analysis of complaints from different boroughs in NYC. 
Close the window of the Histogram.
Please input a 5-digit zipcode of the district you want to live in.
If your input is valid, series of charts will pop up.
You can do some actions to charts such as zooming and saving. 
Please close the window popped up to continue.
After series of charts, please input a valid displayed complaint type to explore the location where the complained issues happened. (Note: Please pay attention to the Case Sensitivity, Format and Space.)

Some Complaint type is not suitable for generating chart so the program will show 'Exception: The Complaint Type Cannot Generate Chart. Please Run the Program Again!', In this case, please run the program again.

It is allowed to input several times of Complaint Type. If you want to continue, please input 'continue'.

When you want to quit the program, please input 'quit'.
